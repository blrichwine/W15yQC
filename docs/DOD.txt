    2. Missing Target Response Choices
       a. Simply disappear
       b. Display a message (visually) that it is broken
       c. Move to alternate target
    3. Target type
       a. Absolute
          i. named anchor
         ii. element with ID
        iii. first ARIA main landmark
         iv. XPATH

    4. Use of CSS
       a. Generate CSS copy copy 'n pasting
       b. Inline with the HTML code (style="")
    5. javaScript behavior
       a. Install link w/JavaScript - if noscript, no link
       b. Fall back to standard skip link
    6. Style - multiple skins to choose from
       a. Appear at top of page as a block element (push page content down)
       b. Appear as popup overlay that floats over location (x, y offset)
       c. Always visible


  THINGS TO DO BEFORE MAKING WEB PAGE VIDEOS AND W15yQC Protocol Instructions:
    -- Check table inspector TH default scope code
    -- Add sorting to all Inspector dialogs [done]
    -- Add page title tests to the site inspector tool and add a message about it in the URL summary
    -- Make and debug Quick Check View with element type label where appropriate (button, checkbox, etc.)
    -- Move the objectToString methods out of the inspect dialog scripts and into the overlay.js script [done]
    -- Should frames have an effective label? Or, is it always just the title attribute? UNLIKELY!!! FIX This! [done]
    -- clean up code that takes a node and requires a document to boot.


  Restore Defaults option in Options Dialog
  Align element objects
    -- apply consistant order
    -- shouldn't they all have state members?
  Hidden documents are not noted as such (iframes tests, iframe with skip class-- how should it be handled?)
    -- links and items in the hidden frame cannot be highlighted and are not listed as being hidden (state==null)
  Verify table inspector
    -- especially pay attention to the default th scope
    -- move position of the labels in the table highlighters. Can they be the first content in the cells instead of the last? [DONE 5/18/2013]

  What does various flash player content sound like to JAWS... youtube, etc. Is it all the same?
  Create test pages for the remove styles view. Besure to include challenging ARIA content. Look for labels that repeat.
  how does <cite> read?
  List of ARIA roles to ignore and warn about not being well supported?
	Generate a set of QA pages for quick sanity check testing. Use pages and a protocol to exercise the program an inspect for errors, unexpected results, and warnings.
    Need to investigate the effective label on ARIA roles -- especially on div, spans, links, etc. Make a list. Spider for common aria roles.
       - Headings
       - buttons
       - sliders
       - etc.
    **** What about nested fieldsets and legends. Do the legends stack? [No, they do not. Need to make sure we provide a warning.]
    **** Add flag to allow ARIA to be sufficient for meeting labeling / text requiremnts(images, form fields, etc.)
    **** Add flag to force empty columns to appear in inspector dialogs
    **** Add flag to force empty columns to appear in HTML reports

    **** Finish inherited role detection

    ***** Check if implicit labels on a form control really preempt explicit labels (when both are present, and update fnGetEffectiveLabel routine)
    ***** Make a QA file for elements that we don't think should get their label from a fieldset legend and verify against JAWS
    MAJOR: Make a QA file for ARIA elements (on divs), and determine how they get their label (role=...)

    ***** Should recursiveText function pick up title attributes on divs and spans?
    Can we get text to wrap in a cell of the trees? Especially for element description fields, table captions, table summaries, determine the others...
    Begin major QA sequence.

                - Accesskeys on buttons
                - Accesskeys on ARIA features

          - Frames OK
          - Headings
             Add label source --FIX IT RIGHT AWAY-- , effective label does not seem to be working on the ARIA headings
             Add heading type

Background for Phase II features:

Are there any decent enterprise accessibility testing tools?

I am the only full time accessibility tester along with a part time person in our organization. We have a huge backlog of applications that need tested and an ever growing list of new ones. We test mobile applications and desktop applications. As far as the newly developed applications, we are doing pretty well keeping up. We have a good process with great tools and great resources. Our problem lies with our huge list of applications that were developed before accessibility was implemented. In addition, other departments and organizations want their applications scanned. We looked at IBM's Rational Policy Tester and after many testing trials, decided against it. We still had to manually sort through so much noise, it wasn't really saving us much time. The scans ran fast so applications that had hundreds of pages would scan fast (the ones it would work on) which was great but then to go through the reports and deciding what was truly real issues and what wasn't took a lot of time. Also, we had many applications that we had trouble getting to run and some that wouldn't run at all. It also showed many duplicate errors under different names. We would also like something we could run on a schedule to use as an auditing tool. I feel there probably isn't a solution out there to do what I'm asking but I thought I would throw this question out there to see what the group thought. I know there is Rational Policy Tester, Deque, Compliance Sheriff, SortSite and SSBart. We've seen Rational and SortSite but not the others. Just to be clear, we were wanting one that crawls through all the pages of the application.
Let me know if you have any ideas on how to handle a large number of applications when you are only 1 1/2 people. :)

Olga Dosis • Hello,

I recommended in the College I work in some tools. One of which is free, the other tool that is used has a night crawler that asses pages over a 24 hour period and provides a report of the accessibility gaps. Send me an email and we can chat further about this.

Kare Romanski • I would recommend checking out SSBBARTGROUP's Accessibility Management Platform (AMP). It will reveal the low hanging fruit without duplication and manually guides you through the things that should be looked at and verified. Works well for Mobile, Web, MAC and PDF accessibility and educates your team.

Kare Romanski • If you are interested in detecting ARIA and contrast violations check out Deque's Worldspace Fire-Eyes Firefox Firebug Addon. While not for automated testing it is very helpful all the same. I use both everyday!

Jeff Orchard • I create work tickets after an analysis in Excel, so a CSV export with useful fields is the first thing I look for in any tool. A 100-page output in HTML, on the other hand, is a dismal waste of time.

The AMP is $1,500/yr, so it must be really good, right? The demo provides a CSV export but the fields don't include the WCAG 2 sufficient criteria code (e.g., 1.3.1 Info and Relationship) or the technical solutions and failures. I wonder if a licensed copy allows those fields to be tailored? I expect adding the WCAG 2 categories would be trivial, but you never know ...

Kare Romanski • The full version provides much more and allows you to export different violation reports by priority, by standard or by instance etc. One of the features I like most about AMP is you don't have to maintain all those rouge spreadsheets which quickly become outdated. AMP allows you to track and monitor compliance over time. You can even create rules to check for specific violations in your code and customize Global (Site-wide) and Pattern (project specific) violations to be turned on or off - further reducing the noise in your reports. There is also a Toolbox of browser addons for Firefox, an Explorer Bar for IE as well as a desktop app that allows you to spider your sites and automate these audits. The staff at SSB Bart Group was very helpful and allowed us to demo the full version before purchasing.

Jeff Orchard • Thanks Kare. The problem with the spreadsheet approach is indeed the trace between reports. I've been considering some Excel kung-fu for matching incidents across reports, but if AMP does this out of the box it's a big checkmark in its column.

I'll see if the SSBBG will also allow me to test the full version. That's quite the price for a solo consultant.

Jeff Orchard • Wes, can the WorldSpace tool match errors across reports, even after a line number shift? A commercial tool that matches errors from a fresh report to errors that have already been analyzed, and via them to the work ticket number, is an expense worth considering. It’s a complete waste of time to wade through issues that have already been ticketed but not yet fixed!
