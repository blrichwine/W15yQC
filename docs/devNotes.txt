/* Dev Notes:
 * 2011.11.17 - Working on methods for determining a node's label
 * 2011.11.19 - Working on methods for determining a node's label (still)
 *              Modeling the results based on JAWS 12 + IE9 on Windows 7
 *              Wondering about how display:none cascades and what happens if a child element of display:none says display:block, who wins?
 *              Refactored out the find recursive text for ID list to take a string of IDs split by ' ' and a document reference
 *              Tested the implicit and explicit label text - debugged and got it working
 * 2011.11.23 - Working on report style rules and getting hide/reveal code for sections to work
 *              Adding code to track and display which document an element is from.
 *              Realized that the SoundEx code isn't returning soundex codes for each word, but one for the whole phrase. Need to fix that!
 *              Excited! Played around with packaging it into a .xpi file for the first time and it worked!
 * 2011.11.27 - Fixed call to SoundEx routine to spell out numbers and then to create soundex codes for each word instead of just one for the whole phrase.
 *              Added setting the language to the body element of the output window.
 *              Added onclick detection to links with href='#' to stop reporting so many '#' as the same href value and different text.
 *                +The onclick values must be different or refer to 'this' to avoid getting flagged as the same href.
 *              Altered the make sortable routine to generate unique and descriptive href values.
 *              Altered the make expand/contract links code to generate unique href values.
 *              Added simple ARIA attribute value checks
 *              Added checks for same page links and that their targets exist
 *              Added code to append table row to break long strings of unbreakable text in td cells
 *              Debugged the hidden node test function, seems to be working better now
 *              Added ARIA role to each inspector
 * 2011.12.23 - Worked on auto XUL Tree column sizing
 *              Worked on calling W3C Validation Service from Documents List Dialog
 * 2011.12.30 - Worked on Forms and Form Controls HTML Report routines.
 *              - Added forms report
 *              - Made auto hidden empty columns for form controls report`
 * 2012.03.01 - Fixed the element highlighter by appending the highlight div element to node.offsetParent instead of node
 * 2012.04.02 - Working on table detection code, adding detection of invalid IDs and non-unique IDs
 * 2012.04.07 - Working on table analysis code
 * 2012.04.11 - Working on table analysis code
 * 2012.04.15 - Worked on table outlining code and debugged element highlighter for scrolled frames
 *              - Moved scrollLeft and scrollTop from doc.documentElement to doc.body
 * 2012.04.25 - Working on table analysis code.
 * 2012.05.08 - Lots of QA Work. QA'd document, frame, and images analysis. Fixed bug in valid ID check
 * 2012.05.15 - QA'd accesskeys, working on adding label, fieldset, and legend to form controls listing
 * 2012.05.22 - Worked on ARIA Landmarks detection to indicate nesting level, worked on ARIA detection code
 * 2012.06.19 - Working on i18n of HTML reports -- need to pick up again at display headings
 * 2012.06.25 - Working on user prefs, added common misspellings from three sources to word list
 * Dev notes are now stored in git commits...

           - if on a cell that is being used as a header (even if a td that is targeted with a headers attribute) highlight all of the cells it applies to.
        ** Table highlight feature
           - extend table highlight feature to have two modes (basic, extended)

    *** FIX ASAP***
    Review priority of issues. How should items that need manual checks be indicated? What is the criteria for failures vs. warnings?
  -- Date URL scanned is null once project is loaded back into project scanner [done 7/4/2013]
  -- *** Fix issue where page description does not display in project window for a URL [done 7/4/2013]
  -- *** display source URL and depth in project window for a URL [done 7/4/2013]

  -- Change text on the stop scanning button to ack it was pressed till it can stop the process... [7/5/2013]
  -- Put progress tracking in sort routine when urlList is greater than x entries. [7/5/2013]
  -- *** Upgrade page load event filter to hold scan till either: [done 7/5/2013]
      -- the page times out (never received a page load filter)
      -- A page load event was received, but no page load events in the last 1 second
      -- It's been over 5 seconds since the first page load event was received however they keep occurring.
  -- Export results as csv file [done 7/5/2013]
  -- Search for url, page title, feature in project scanner!!!
  -- Log URLs that don't match the project specs
  -- install unit tests for urls are equal and normalization routines
  -- project settings to add: don't add links on pages with more than x URLs, max URLs
  -- *** Don't create regular expressions for the equivalent domains to speed up the checking.
  -- *** Upgrade the equivalent URL code for the link checks so it will be faster in the fnAnalyzeLinks function.
  -- *** Add config option to always make www.somedomain.com === somedomain.com [7/6/2013]

  -- Placeholder space.
  -- Put appropriate dialog title in on the remove styles view, choose appropriate tool name, display page title and summary of link counts, etc. in the remove styles view.
  -- Filter out the list graphic symbols, other non-pronouncable symbols, in semantic view. Especially so fake lists are made apparent.
  -- Can we substitute default JAWS pronounciation of characters? Should this take place in sounds like testing, too?
  -- Outline data tables in semantic view. Provide very light background for table headers.
  -- Indicate form controls marked as required by inserting (required) in front of them in semantic view.
  -- Detect symbol characters that might represent fake lists, and flag them as warnings.
  -- Improve dominant aria roles routine to ignore the native role (h2 is OK with heading role, button is OK with the button role, etc.)
  -- Site Summary (similar to page summary)
  -- Site Statistics
     -- Page Score Histogram
  -- Have links on the W15yQC website underlined in the body text.
  -- Detect CSS background images? Sprites? What are common patterns
  -- Detect and list font usage? Look for icon fonts?
  -- Quick Report
    -- Finish fnJAWSAnnouncesControlAs [done]
    -- Only show elements that would be listed by AT
       -- Don't list images [done]
       -- Don't list labels [done]
       -- Don't list elements which have their roles overriden
       -- Make sure elements are listed in the correct list dialogs (links or form controls)
           -- Which ARIA widgets get listed in the form controls?
       -- Make sure the appropriate rules are used in the quick report.
       -- Include form control type when displaying effective label
  HTML Reports should use the effective label values
  Verify each analysis routine is using the effective label value to check for uniqueness, meaningfulness, etc.
  THINGS TO DO BEFORE MAKING WEB PAGE VIDEOS AND W15yQC Protocol Instructions:
    -- Check table inspector TH default scope code
    -- Add sorting to all Inspector dialogs [done]
    -- Add page title tests to the site inspector tool and add a message about it in the URL summary
    -- Make and debug Quick Check View with element type label where appropriate (button, checkbox, etc.)
    -- Move the objectToString methods out of the inspect dialog scripts and into the overlay.js script [done]
    -- Should frames have an effective label? Or, is it always just the title attribute? UNLIKELY!!! FIX This! [done]
    -- clean up code that takes a node and requires a document to boot.


  Restore Defaults option in Options Dialog
  Align element objects
    -- apply consistant order
    -- shouldn't they all have state members?
  Hidden documents are not noted as such (iframes tests, iframe with skip class-- how should it be handled?)
    -- links and items in the hidden frame cannot be highlighted and are not listed as being hidden (state==null)
  Verify table inspector
    -- especially pay attention to the default th scope
    -- move position of the labels in the table highlighters. Can they be the first content in the cells instead of the last? [DONE 5/18/2013]

  What does various flash player content sound like to JAWS... youtube, etc. Is it all the same?
  Create test pages for the remove styles view. Besure to include challenging ARIA content. Look for labels that repeat.
  how does <cite> read?
  List of ARIA roles to ignore and warn about not being well supported?
	Generate a set of QA pages for quick sanity check testing. Use pages and a protocol to exercise the program an inspect for errors, unexpected results, and warnings.
    Need to investigate the effective label on ARIA roles -- especially on div, spans, links, etc. Make a list. Spider for common aria roles.
       - Headings
       - buttons
       - sliders
       - etc.
    **** What about nested fieldsets and legends. Do the legends stack? [No, they do not. Need to make sure we provide a warning.]
    **** Add flag to allow ARIA to be sufficient for meeting labeling / text requiremnts(images, form fields, etc.)
    **** Add flag to force empty columns to appear in inspector dialogs
    **** Add flag to force empty columns to appear in HTML reports

    **** Finish inherited role detection

    ***** Check if implicit labels on a form control really preempt explicit labels (when both are present, and update fnGetEffectiveLabel routine)
    ***** Make a QA file for elements that we don't think should get their label from a fieldset legend and verify against JAWS
    MAJOR: Make a QA file for ARIA elements (on divs), and determine how they get their label (role=...)

    ***** Should recursiveText function pick up title attributes on divs and spans?
    Can we get text to wrap in a cell of the trees? Especially for element description fields, table captions, table summaries, determine the others...
    Begin major QA sequence.

      IUADAPTS Kurzweil 3000 FAQ page, same page links are producing errors. Is this a real concern?
        -- W15yQC is not seeing the <a id="sdfsd">fasdfasdf</a> as a "named" anchor.
        -- Test the page with JAWS and see if the anchors are showing up in the links list. If so, that is probably a problem.
      HTML5 allows rich IDs. Do we need to update the Valid ID routines? Do we need to be sensitive to doctype when testing IDs?
      Apparently name attribute values can be "rich", what ever that means, and include entities. If so, we need to look at the valid name routines.
      Accessibility quick tips : Abandon your mouse for a few days and see what the exerience is like.
      remove styles view - filter out characters that screen readers don't announce
      remove styles view - include page title, counts of key semantic features
      audit each of the remove highlights routines to see if they really clean everything up.
      if link or button contains no text, but has text that is hidden with display:none or the such, provide a warning on the use of display:none
      look up common skip navigation link texts
      look for meaningful content inside of role="application" and provide warning.
      Look for inappropriate role="application" use.
      Moan about keyboard accessibility issues
        - A elements without HREF attributes that have onclick handlers

      warn when link title text is different than the effective link text and the aria-descriptions
      Audit all objects and verify each property has a value set in the contructor. Test that objects are doing what we think they are doing.
      Hints on how to detect listeners? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.removeEventListener
      Ratio of text that is structured vs. unstructure (contained in an ARIA Landmark vs. Not, etc.)
      Option to ask what domain to consider documents with file:// as their URL as (so local files can be treated as on a server somewhere)
      Back to back links do not have a space between them (Sakai 2.9 skip nav links are an example)
      In form control list, highlight label elements with a different background color. Place a title attribute on the element that says "label" or "form control"
      If a link has a role of presentation on it, and is in a list (current tool in tools list of sakai 2.9 portal, does JAWS announce it when moving through the list?
        Currently it is not listed in the remove styles view.)
      Detect alt text for Flash objects, other embedded objects, canvas, etc.
      Add effective label columns to the appropriate HTML Report sections and inspector dialogs
      Add blr.W15yQC.bQuick = false; to each inspector dialog -- maybe not, added it to the open dialog routine.
      Find pronounciation dictionary, use Perl to create list of homonyms by reverse indexing the pronounciation codes, create expanded list from this.
      Use the spider link text word report to create list of popular tokens that are not in the dictionary, examine them and analyze
      If a token starts with i or e, (iPhone), then see if the word minus the first letter is in the homonym list. If so, separate it (eye, e)
      Need smart scroll to feature.
        - Right now it scrolls to the top each element and makes it difficult to see. How can we scroll it only part way?
        - Can we only scroll it when necessary?
        - Can we center it vertically?

        - Should all images have alt attribute? Decide if images with ARIA labels and no alt attribute should be flagged for not having alternative text.
          Currently they are called out for not having an alt attribute.
        - JAWS TESTS
           - How does JAWS read input[type=image]?
           - What happens to headings (view in headings list dialog) when heading has a landmark role on it?
           - Caption and figcaption
           - multiple accesskey values
           - table headers and colgroup
           - table headers without scope attributes in the 1,1 position. What happens. What do they label?
           - table headers with scope=rowgroup
           - table headers with scope=colgroup
           - aria-describedby or other aria labels on tables. Consider adding it to the table tools.
           - disabled attribute on the fieldset element
           - canvas tag child content / alt content
        - Disabled attribute on the fieldset element
        - Remove styles view, show semantics: details+summary, HTML5 aside, etc., figure+figcaption
        - Handle ARIA in remove styles view
        - Load configuration from a file (rules to include, exclude, expert level, ignores, etc.)
        - Add lang attribute highlighter that highlights language changes
        - overlay.xul: wrap the opendialog call in an extra (empty catch) try catch block so the second call to open.dialog doesn't take place on error in the dialog itself.
        - Need a print CSS file for the HTML Report - background images are not printing!
        - Canvas tags -- detect alt text, list in with images (truncate if necessary)
           -- Make sure content contained in a canvas tag shows up in the w15yqc results -- it is fallback content -- how to list?
           -- Test how the focus highlighter works with the fallback content
           -- Spider for examples of useless fallback canvas content
           -- Test for useless fallback content
        - Semantic view should include any fallback content from applicable tags (canvas)
        - Create misc section?

        - Make HTML table reports rows tabable with a tabindex and accessible with N and shift N.
        - Make HTML table report enhanced line item view dialog.
        - Make HTML table report each section have a page level note regardless of any issues. (to allow editing)
        - Make HTML table line item editor
           - Delete individual note

           - Options?
              -Remove silent punctuation / symbols?
              -Linearize tables? [layout, data tables, both, none]
        - cancel button on theCN.com create assignment page shows up as unlabeled when the type is reset and the value is cancel. What does it show up as to JAWS?
        - Indicate which notes a label applies to.
        - validate the extension in mozilla extension validator, run security checks, perform jslint
        - clean up the try/catch blocks
        - ****What about HTML5 Hidden attribute?
           - What values for the hidden attribute work in FF, IE, and Safari? Which don't (if any)
        - Update options dialog with new features
        - ** form control labels (checked with any legend text applied)
               - yes/no what?
               - y/n what?

        - ****Detect spans,divs, etc. with onclick attributes that can't be tabbed to
               - If they have no role, fail them, list as form controls
               - If they have valid roles (button, link, ???) and are not disabled, provide a different fail message.
               - If they don't have a onkeypress or other appropriate handler, fail them.
               - If they do have an apparent keypress handler, note that it needs to be tested.
        - ****Detect form controls that aren't hidden but can't be tabbed to.
               - ARIA roles without tabindex (fail)

        - **** Fix form control label detection (fieldsets, legend, label, aria role="group")
        - **** select elements with onchange -- make sure a warning is given in the form control's listing
        - **** each fieldset should contain a legend (Radio buttons require this already)
        - **** Input elements where type=[button|submit|reset] must have a value or title attribute.
        - Do <label>, <fieldset> work on ARIA form control roles (button, radio, etc.) IF NOT, fix effectiveLabel function
        - Font size too small (links, buttons, form controls' labels)
        - Detect code <font,i,b,em,etc tags> and add a manual check to make sure the information if important, is somehow described accessibly
        - Detect skip to main content links, make sure they are close to the top. Analyze coding used on edu sites and how deep they are in the code after the body element.
        - DETERMINE WHICH ELEMENTS FIELDSET LEGENDS APPLY TO, RADIOGROUPs
        - QUESTION: Do div's that have a title attribute and can get focus get announced by screen-readers when they get focus?
        - Which elements have child text that works as a label for ARIA form control roles (radio?)
        - Check for elements that activate TOC heading level mode and warn at the doc level

        - In document list, don't list URL on documents that are script generated. (http://webaim.org/blog/four-keys-to-accessibility/)
        - check label is labeling appropriate form control, guess by location of label vs. location of other control's label
        - FEATURE ADD: Compute largest square that fits in an area's target. Check if it is too small to hit reliably. (have on links, need on buttons and other targets)
        - image maps

           - Does each area tag of an image map with an empty href have an empty alt attribute?
           - Does the equivalent link text for an area tag meet link text requirements (include in links list? Test with JAWS obviously)
           - add areas to links [done]
        - Check for focusable elements that have the focus outline reset [needs further development -- too many false positives]

 *      - Data tables must:
 *         - use the summary attribute OA7 *
 *         - use th cells OA8
 *         - summary content must be unique to summary and caption content on other tables
 *         - caption content shoould not be "layout", "layout table", "table for layout"

 QA Steps to perform before releases
   1) Check version info is correct
       - Examine 'version' variable in blr.W15yQC
       - Run HTML Report and examine report footer
       - Examine version info in About dialog
   2) Run through QA Test pages and check for expected results
   3) Run HTML report on major websites to verify no unexpected results or behavior
       - cnn.com
       - iub.edu
       - indiana.edu
       - nightly2.sakaiproject.org servers
       - iupui.edu
       - iuadapts.indiana.edu
       - examine results of running on: http://webaim.org/blog/four-keys-to-accessibility/, of running on wave beta results
       - compare results on running against FAE on several pages (link text, form control text, headings)
    4) Run through the Mozilla extension validator

 Steps to perform to issue release
    1) Upload to download section on github
    2) Update download links on the website
    2) Upload to Mozilla

 Steps to perform after a release
    1) Search google for new release by file name, by description text, on multiple computers
    2) Download new release from web site and install in multiple firefox versions
        - Verify basic functionality (sanity checks)
        - Verify version number is correct



Simple protocol development:
      Accessibility Quick Checks:
         Page title
         Page language

         Skip Navigation
         Page Headings
         Links
         Form Labels

        Page or Document Title
        Headings and Subheadings
        Link Text
        Table Headers and Captions
        Form Design Considerations
        Contrast or Luminosity/Brightness
        Color Issues
        Fonts and Text Layout

        Charts & Accessibility


Background for Phase II features:

Are there any decent enterprise accessibility testing tools?

I am the only full time accessibility tester along with a part time person in our organization. We have a huge backlog of applications that need tested and an ever growing list of new ones. We test mobile applications and desktop applications. As far as the newly developed applications, we are doing pretty well keeping up. We have a good process with great tools and great resources. Our problem lies with our huge list of applications that were developed before accessibility was implemented. In addition, other departments and organizations want their applications scanned. We looked at IBM's Rational Policy Tester and after many testing trials, decided against it. We still had to manually sort through so much noise, it wasn't really saving us much time. The scans ran fast so applications that had hundreds of pages would scan fast (the ones it would work on) which was great but then to go through the reports and deciding what was truly real issues and what wasn't took a lot of time. Also, we had many applications that we had trouble getting to run and some that wouldn't run at all. It also showed many duplicate errors under different names. We would also like something we could run on a schedule to use as an auditing tool. I feel there probably isn't a solution out there to do what I'm asking but I thought I would throw this question out there to see what the group thought. I know there is Rational Policy Tester, Deque, Compliance Sheriff, SortSite and SSBart. We've seen Rational and SortSite but not the others. Just to be clear, we were wanting one that crawls through all the pages of the application.
Let me know if you have any ideas on how to handle a large number of applications when you are only 1 1/2 people. :)

Olga Dosis  Hello,

I recommended in the College I work in some tools. One of which is free, the other tool that is used has a night crawler that asses pages over a 24 hour period and provides a report of the accessibility gaps. Send me an email and we can chat further about this.

Kare Romanski  I would recommend checking out SSBBARTGROUP's Accessibility Management Platform (AMP). It will reveal the low hanging fruit without duplication and manually guides you through the things that should be looked at and verified. Works well for Mobile, Web, MAC and PDF accessibility and educates your team.

Kare Romanski  If you are interested in detecting ARIA and contrast violations check out Deque's Worldspace Fire-Eyes Firefox Firebug Addon. While not for automated testing it is very helpful all the same. I use both everyday!

Jeff Orchard  I create work tickets after an analysis in Excel, so a CSV export with useful fields is the first thing I look for in any tool. A 100-page output in HTML, on the other hand, is a dismal waste of time.

The AMP is $1,500/yr, so it must be really good, right? The demo provides a CSV export but the fields don't include the WCAG 2 sufficient criteria code (e.g., 1.3.1 Info and Relationship) or the technical solutions and failures. I wonder if a licensed copy allows those fields to be tailored? I expect adding the WCAG 2 categories would be trivial, but you never know ...

Kare Romanski  The full version provides much more and allows you to export different violation reports by priority, by standard or by instance etc. One of the features I like most about AMP is you don't have to maintain all those rouge spreadsheets which quickly become outdated. AMP allows you to track and monitor compliance over time. You can even create rules to check for specific violations in your code and customize Global (Site-wide) and Pattern (project specific) violations to be turned on or off - further reducing the noise in your reports. There is also a Toolbox of browser addons for Firefox, an Explorer Bar for IE as well as a desktop app that allows you to spider your sites and automate these audits. The staff at SSB Bart Group was very helpful and allowed us to demo the full version before purchasing.

Jeff Orchard  Thanks Kare. The problem with the spreadsheet approach is indeed the trace between reports. I've been considering some Excel kung-fu for matching incidents across reports, but if AMP does this out of the box it's a big checkmark in its column.

I'll see if the SSBBG will also allow me to test the full version. That's quite the price for a solo consultant.

Kare Romanski  In this case, you do get what you pay for and it is well worth the expense just in the time it saves trying to monitor compliance over time.

Jeff Orchard  Wes, can the WorldSpace tool match errors across reports, even after a line number shift? A commercial tool that matches errors from a fresh report to errors that have already been analyzed, and via them to the work ticket number, is an expense worth considering. Its a complete waste of time to wade through issues that have already been ticketed but not yet fixed!
