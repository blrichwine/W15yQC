/* Dev Notes:
 * 2011.11.17 - Working on methods for determining a node's label
 * 2011.11.19 - Working on methods for determining a node's label (still)
 *              Modeling the results based on JAWS 12 + IE9 on Windows 7
 *              Wondering about how display:none cascades and what happens if a child element of display:none says display:block, who wins?
 *              Refactored out the find recursive text for ID list to take a string of IDs split by ' ' and a document reference
 *              Tested the implicit and explicit label text - debugged and got it working
 * 2011.11.23 - Working on report style rules and getting hide/reveal code for sections to work
 *              Adding code to track and display which document an element is from.
 *              Realized that the SoundEx code isn't returning soundex codes for each word, but one for the whole phrase. Need to fix that!
 *              Excited! Played around with packaging it into a .xpi file for the first time and it worked!
 * 2011.11.27 - Fixed call to SoundEx routine to spell out numbers and then to create soundex codes for each word instead of just one for the whole phrase.
 *              Added setting the language to the body element of the output window.
 *              Added onclick detection to links with href='#' to stop reporting so many '#' as the same href value and different text.
 *                +The onclick values must be different or refer to 'this' to avoid getting flagged as the same href.
 *              Altered the make sortable routine to generate unique and descriptive href values.
 *              Altered the make expand/contract links code to generate unique href values.
 *              Added simple ARIA attribute value checks
 *              Added checks for same page links and that their targets exist
 *              Added code to append table row to break long strings of unbreakable text in td cells
 *              Debugged the hidden node test function, seems to be working better now
 *              Added ARIA role to each inspector
 * 2011.12.23 - Worked on auto XUL Tree column sizing
 *              Worked on calling W3C Validation Service from Documents List Dialog

 * 2012.03.01 - Fixed the element highlighter by appending the highlight div element to node.offsetParent instead of node
 * 2012.04.02 - Working on table detection code, adding detection of invalid IDs and non-unique IDs
 * 2012.04.07 - Working on table analysis code
 * 2012.04.11 - Working on table analysis code

 *              - Moved scrollLeft and scrollTop from doc.documentElement to doc.body
 * 2012.04.25 - Working on table analysis code.
 * 2012.05.08 - Lots of QA Work. QA'd document, frame, and images analysis. Fixed bug in valid ID check
 * 2012.05.15 - QA'd accesskeys, working on adding label, fieldset, and legend to form controls listing
 * 2012.05.22 - Worked on ARIA Landmarks detection to indicate nesting level, worked on ARIA detection code
 * 2012.06.19 - Working on i18n of HTML reports -- need to pick up again at display headings
 * 2012.06.25 - Working on user prefs, added common misspellings from three sources to word list

      *** Feature Expansion ***
        ** Page Summary
        ** Page Review History
        ** Manual Page Review Checks
        ** Storage of Page Results
        ** Data table inspector
           - Scroll to and Highlight table
           - List table results
           - List Summary, Caption
           - List table features
              - dimensions, complex?, rowspans, colspans?, row/col collisions?, nested tables?
              - use of theader, tfooter, th's w or wo scope, axis, headers attributes
              - list of axis values (case insensitive?)
           - list cell features / issues
           - Table cell navigator (scroll to cell, highlight cell [use color for errors] and related cells (headers), list cell features in dialog box, show cell coding w/xpath, show in firebug)
           - table cell validity checks
           - if on a cell that is being used as a header (even if a td that is targeted with a headers attribute) highlight all of the cells it applies to.
        ** Table highlight feature
           - extend table highlight feature to have two modes (basic, extended)
           - extended mode reveals headings for cell, summary, caption, thead rows, tfoot rows, th cells vs td cells, if cell has scope, highlight the border of the scope direction
           - basic mode -- distinguish between datatables and layout tables
        ** New Data table checks
           - handle scope=colgroup, provide warning if not provided
           - data table if contains axis, abbr
           - make sure axis value is valid (well, probably can't do this. axis is csv cdata)
           - make sure scope values are valid
           - warn on td cell having scope attribute
           - recommended manual page checks
              - axis values are valid
              - summary is accurate
              - caption value is accurate

             Drop out certain checks for speed when spidering
            
      *** FIX ASAP***
        - What about definition lists / highlighting?
        - Handle ARIA in remove styles view
           - What happens to headings (view in headings list dialog) when heading has a landmark role on it?
        - DETERMINE HOW JAWS LINEARIZES A TABLE WITH ROW SPAN VALUES then linearize layout tables in semantic view
            - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/table.rows
        - Load configuration from a file (rules to include, exclude, expert level, ignores, etc.)
        - Add support for closing window with appropriate key in windows.
        - Add lang attribute highlighter that highlights language changes
        - overlay.xul: wrap the opendialog call in an extra (empty catch) try catch block so the second call to open.dialog doesn't take place on error in the dialog itself.
        - Need a print CSS file for the HTML Report - background images are not printing!
        - Canvas tags -- detect alt text, list in with images (truncate if necessary)
           -- Make sure content contained in a canvas tag shows up in the w15yqc results -- it is fallback content -- how to list?
           -- Test how the focus highlighter works with the fallback content
           -- Spider for examples of useless fallback canvas content
           -- Test for useless fallback content
        - Semantic view should include any fallback content from applicable tags (canvas)
        - Semantic view 
        - Create misc section?
        - Make HTML table reports rows tabable with a tabindex and accessible with N and shift N.
        - Make HTML table report enhanced line item view dialog.
        - Make HTML table report each section have a page level note regardless of any issues. (to allow editing)
        - Make HTML table line item editor
           - Delete individual note
           - Report that a note is not an issue
           - Report that a note is fixed
           - Manually add a note
           - Add comments on over all line item
           - Add comments on a note.
        - Remove styles
           - Options?
              -Remove silent punctuation / symbols?
              -Linearize tables? [layout, data tables, both, none]
           - Show ARIA info (labels, descriptions, landmarks, etc.)
        - cancel button on theCN.com create assignment page shows up as unlabeled when the type is reset and the value is cancel. What does it show up as to JAWS?
        - Note how a form control is labeled (label element, fieldset+legend, group, aria-, etc. and include in notes.)
        - Indicate which notes a label applies to.
        - validate the extension in mozilla extension validator, run security checks, perform jslint
        - clean up the try/catch blocks
        - Doctype info: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6088972/get-doctype-of-an-html-as-string-with-javascript
        - ****What about HTML5 Hidden attribute?
           - What values for the hidden attribute work in FF, IE, and Safari? Which don't (if any)
        - links on w3schools website don't highlight correctly... why?
        - Update options dialog with new features
        - ** form control labels (checked with any legend text applied)
               - yes/no what?
               - y/n what?
               - true/false what?
               - t/f what?
               - next/previous what?
               - all what?
               - zoom (zoom in? zoom out?)
        - ****Detect spans,divs, etc. with onclick attributes that can't be tabbed to
               - If they have no role, fail them, list as form controls
               - If they have valid roles (button, link, ???) and are not disabled, provide a different fail message.
               - If they don't have a onkeypress or other appropriate handler, fail them.
               - If they do have an apparent keypress handler, note that it needs to be tested.
        - ****Detect form controls that aren't hidden but can't be tabbed to.
               - ARIA roles without tabindex (fail)
               - standard form controls with tabindex=-1 (warn)
        - **** Look for places that can use blr.W15yQC.fnStringHasContent(
        - **** Detect ARIA overrides of native tag semantics -- what is acceptable? what is not? (This should be in the aria roles checks)
        - **** test role="group" effects
        - **** In each selection list (select tag), does each list item grouping (optgroup tag) have a label attribute?
        - **** How does JAWS announce the various form controls? Make a function to return string announced by JAWS.
        - **** QA state listing on ARIA landmarks -- doesn't appear to be working
        - **** Form controls HTML list should show 'alt' column when a valid instance of alt is present and the effective label comes from one
        - **** Fix form control label detection (fieldsets, legend, label, aria role="group")
        - **** select elements with onchange -- make sure a warning is given in the form control's listing
        - **** each fieldset should contain a legend (Radio buttons require this already)
        - **** Input elements where type=[button|submit|reset] must have a value or title attribute.
        - Do <label>, <fieldset> work on ARIA form control roles (button, radio, etc.) IF NOT, fix effectiveLabel function
        - Font size too small (links, buttons, form controls' labels)
        - Detect code <font,i,b,em,etc tags> and add a manual check to make sure the information if important, is somehow described accessibly
        - Detect skip to main content links, make sure they are close to the top. Analyze coding used on edu sites and how deep they are in the code after the body element.
        - DETERMINE WHICH ELEMENTS FIELDSET LEGENDS APPLY TO, RADIOGROUPs
        - QUESTION: Do div's that have a title attribute and can get focus get announced by screen-readers when they get focus?
        - Which elements have child text that works as a label for ARIA form control roles (radio?)
        - Check for elements that activate TOC heading level mode and warn at the doc level
        - Add why invalid ID routine
        - QA Form Control Test [].
        - In document list, don't list URL on documents that are script generated. (http://webaim.org/blog/four-keys-to-accessibility/)
        - check label is labeling appropriate form control, guess by location of label vs. location of other control's label
        - FEATURE ADD: Compute largest square that fits in an area's target. Check if it is too small to hit reliably. (have on links, need on buttons and other targets)
        - image maps
           - Does each area tag of an image map have an alt attribute [done]
           - Does each area tag of an image map with an empty href have an empty alt attribute?
           - Does the equivalent link text for an area tag meet link text requirements (include in links list? Test with JAWS obviously)
           - add areas to links [done]
        - Check for focusable elements that have the focus outline reset [needs further development -- too many false positives]
        - Verify that these are required to have labels: input tag of type text, password, checkbox, radio, file, or textarea and select tags
        - Does each applet tag, applet image have an alt attribute?
        - What about object or embed tags with type="image/..."
        - QA Dialog to detect non-unique, invalid IDs
        - QA support for ARIA headings
 *      - Fix landmark list, create real qa file for aria landmarks with nested landmarks

 *        - no for attribute, doesn't wrap control
 *        - for attribute doesn't have a valid id
 *        - id in for attribute doesn't exist
 *        - id points to control that isn't a form control (shouldn't be labeled)
 *      - Length of alt text OA
 *      - Data tables must:
 *         - use the summary attribute OA7 *
 *         - use th cells OA8 
 *         - summary content must be unique to summary and caption content on other tables
 *         - caption content shoould not be "layout", "layout table", "table for layout"
 *         - summary content should not be "layout", "layout table", "table for layout"
 *         - appropriate length of summary or caption text?
 *         - not be be nested?
 *      - Table summary
 *         - If a table is otherwise a layout table, check if summary is invalid
 *             - look for "layout table", "layout", "for layout", "summary", "table summary", "table", "header table", "Content table", "footer", "footer table",
 *               "Navigation", "Navigation table", "Nav table", "content", ARIA Landmark role values, "(Top|left|right|bottom|side)* (hand)* nav(igation)* (table)*"

 *      
 *    - Redundant links were not being flagged when href="#". Put in a check for this, what other
 *      similar checks need to be performed? Anything with href and onclick? Check for attached
 *      event handlers?
 *    - Make a phased implementation of this! Determine which TODO items go in which phase so we can publish a version!
 *    - Make a protocol for inspecting a traditional web page using this tool. Document using videos!
 *
 *    -TODO: Vet these
 *      -fnGetDisplayableTextRecursively
 *    - CODE INSPECTIONS
 *       - Use method to get node attributes
 *    - READ and Learn
 *      - http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#textalternativecomputation
 *    - RESEARCH
 *       Do HTML Entities work in alt text?
 *    - Document Checks
 *    - Code Fixes:
 *      - Recursive functions should call arguments.callee(...) instead of the named function
 *    - Form Controls:
 *      - Respect HTML5 attributes?
 *        - form
 *        - required
 *      - Add label column (from label tags)
 *      - Add "Effective Label" column
 *      - Add ARIA Description column
 *      - Add form control type (input[type=text], textarea, etc.)
 *      - Add JAWS label (combobox, etc.) and add to effective label
 *      - What are the ARIA form control roles? What should be listed there?
 *      - What about non-landmark ARIA List? 
 *
 *    - Detect links, references to WCAG techniques, etc in warning/error messages and make them active when displayed.
 *    - Make effective label routine that:
 *       - Vet results for link labeling
 *       - Checks for ARIA role / labels first since that seems to take priority over tag
 *       - Determines what a screen-reader will announce for any element (link, heading, form control (including legend))
 *    - Include child text on appropriate element descriptions (button, etc.)
 *    - Validate documents in WAI Validator
 *       - Create assumed doctype from document values and paste that in when using DOM for source
 *    - Invoke WAVE from DOM? <Why? The WAVE tool bar can do this.>
 *    - Find non-link, button elements that have onclicks without appropriate role values
 *    - HTML5 Outliner view
 *    - Long description attribute on images, frames, others (look it up)?
 *    - Effective Label for images
 *    - Test alt attribute for image filename formats and flag them as possibly meaningless.
 *    - Test longdesc attribute: link works, has text content, etc.
 *    - Note images used in links
 *    - Note elements with background images
 *    - Check checkbox labels, doesn't appear to pick up title attribute (check all on worksite setup)
 *    - Update state description to include Hidden with info incase we decide to offer the option
 *    - Put in a page footer with optional config settings, date/time, version of tool, author of tool, etc.
 *    - failed to find explict label for textarea for short-description field in form on defining new site.
 *    - legend + ascii symbols are not caught. joe brought it up. <check if fixed or not>
 *    - Check that radio buttons have other radio buttons with the same name attribute value in the same form
 *    - Get ARIA attribute checks routine fleshed out
 *       + If same role and label, give warning
 *    - Understand if the hidden element routine is working [Create QA files to test this]
 *    - Make table headings unique so the sort links are unique and indicate current sort status in text
 *      If a input element has an implicit label, how does the child text work for the label if the input element has a title attribute or other text on it?
 *      Child text for various tags, child images, child input elements (including type=image, buttons, etc.), child text with hidden elements
 *      
 *    - Internationalize?
