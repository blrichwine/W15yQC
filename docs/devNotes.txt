/* Dev Notes:
 * 2011.11.17 - Working on methods for determining a node's label
 * 2011.11.19 - Working on methods for determining a node's label (still)
 *              Modeling the results based on JAWS 12 + IE9 on Windows 7
 *              Wondering about how display:none cascades and what happens if a child element of display:none says display:block, who wins?
 *              Refactored out the find recursive text for ID list to take a string of IDs split by ' ' and a document reference
 *              Tested the implicit and explicit label text - debugged and got it working
 * 2011.11.23 - Working on report style rules and getting hide/reveal code for sections to work
 *              Adding code to track and display which document an element is from.
 *              Realized that the SoundEx code isn't returning soundex codes for each word, but one for the whole phrase. Need to fix that!
 *              Excited! Played around with packaging it into a .xpi file for the first time and it worked!
 * 2011.11.27 - Fixed call to SoundEx routine to spell out numbers and then to create soundex codes for each word instead of just one for the whole phrase.
 *              Added setting the language to the body element of the output window.
 *              Added onclick detection to links with href='#' to stop reporting so many '#' as the same href value and different text.
 *                +The onclick values must be different or refer to 'this' to avoid getting flagged as the same href.
 *              Altered the make sortable routine to generate unique and descriptive href values.
 *              Altered the make expand/contract links code to generate unique href values.
 *              Added simple ARIA attribute value checks
 *              Added checks for same page links and that their targets exist
 *              Added code to append table row to break long strings of unbreakable text in td cells
 *              Debugged the hidden node test function, seems to be working better now
 *              Added ARIA role to each inspector
 * 2011.12.23 - Worked on auto XUL Tree column sizing
 *              Worked on calling W3C Validation Service from Documents List Dialog
 * 2011.12.30 - Worked on Forms and Form Controls HTML Report routines.
 *              - Added forms report
 *              - Made auto hidden empty columns for form controls report`
 * 2012.03.01 - Fixed the element highlighter by appending the highlight div element to node.offsetParent instead of node
 * 2012.04.02 - Working on table detection code, adding detection of invalid IDs and non-unique IDs
 * 2012.04.07 - Working on table analysis code
 * 2012.04.11 - Working on table analysis code
 * 2012.04.15 - Worked on table outlining code and debugged element highlighter for scrolled frames
 *              - Moved scrollLeft and scrollTop from doc.documentElement to doc.body
 * 2012.04.25 - Working on table analysis code.
 * 2012.05.08 - Lots of QA Work. QA'd document, frame, and images analysis. Fixed bug in valid ID check
 * 2012.05.15 - QA'd accesskeys, working on adding label, fieldset, and legend to form controls listing
 * 2012.05.22 - Worked on ARIA Landmarks detection to indicate nesting level, worked on ARIA detection code
 * 2012.06.19 - Working on i18n of HTML reports -- need to pick up again at display headings
 * 2012.06.25 - Working on user prefs, added common misspellings from three sources to word list
 * Dev notes are now stored in git commits...

    *** FIX ASAP***
  -- is aria-describedby working on links? http://www.uchicago.edu/
       Hmmm... OK: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_aria-describedby_for_link_purpose , so it does...
       Do links use effectiveLabel routine? Not seeing a label source... need to dig further
  -- explore how jaws and NVDA and window eyes come up with link text
  -- what elements does aria-describedby work on? How should it be considered as far as labeling
  -- create a settings object and consider how it would be used. How do settings differ from plug-in prefs?
  -- Privacy information
  -- Feedback / Comments feature
  -- How others can help
  -- Known bugs list
  -- Improve Auto configure project scanner
  -- Does "not all text contained in a landmark" failure include HTML5 section elements appropriately?
  -- List abbreviation tags found and what the tag says the abbreviation is.
  -- Add inspector for abbreviation tags [done]
  -- Spider web pages for abbr tags and see if anything can be learned from the results (default values, possible errors).
  -- List if abbreviation tags are found in the document stats
  -- Not all failures are showing up in HTML report summary (i.e., documents without default lang cause failure, but it was not counted in summary when explaining the score)
  -- Develop unit test platform
     -- run as separate dialog
     -- include ability to run tests from a folder outside of package
     -- ability to remember test configuration to ease running of tests
     -- tests for each accessibility failure, warning, note
     -- tests for color contrast computations
     -- tests for string, url, etc. handling functions
  -- ability to run project scanner on local files -- does this work?
  -- Get rid of "check links" option in option dialog, and add check links feature to links inspector dialog
  -- Better detection of elements with background images (less false positives when checking contrast -- is this possible?)
  -- Check contrast between link text and surrounding text if link text is not underlined.
  -- is search role valid on a form element? WebAIM recommends it, so lets allow it.
  -- check for links in navigation role. Are the links in a list?
  -- warn on tabindex values that are 1 or higher.
      When implementing a page that contains a large number of focusable elements arranged via CSS and using methods to adapt the layout to multiple device form factors, what alternatives would you recommend to control the tab order?
      Also, I would appreciate any elaboration on why tabindex “causes more accessibility issues than it solves”.
  -- role="presentation" fail if on links or form controls.
  -- role="presentation" on images, fail if image has alternate text (what happens here... test with JAWS)
  -- test for display:none, visibility:hidden, or aria-hidden on skip links and fail/warn on them.
  -- Make sure the link, headings, images, and form control inspectors display the label/link text/alt text/etc. on the first line in the notes panel for the selected element
  -- radio groups are listed as fieldsets in the label source. can this be fixed to note the real aria source? http://webaim.org/presentations/2012/ahgaria/radiogroup2
  -- Include HTML5 Section elements as Landmarks Option
  -- banner, main, and contentinfo landmarks only appear once
  -- warn on role="application" that area of the page needs to be tested with assistive technologies (screen-readers), by someone who can't see and didn't write the widget
      look for meaningful content inside of role="application" and provide warning.
      Look for inappropriate role="application" use.
      Be very careful with <body role="application">.
             + Users cannot easily leave forms mode.
             + Screen reader sends all keystrokes to the page/browser/application.
             + Standard A.T. keystrokes are disabled. disables standard A.T. keystrokes to allow the page to function like a desktop application
      Some ARIA elements (tree view, slider, table, tabs, dialog, toolbar, menus, etc.) have an assumed application role.


  -- Look for too many landmarks (how many is too many?)
  -- language attribute checking:
    The required version of the lang attribute varies with the doctype:
     -For html pages use lang="en".
     -For xhtml 1.0 pages, use both lang="en" and xml:lang="en".
     -For xhtml 1.1 pages, use xml:lang="en".
  -- Create highlightersDev.html page with challenging content for the highlighters to work on for testing and development
  -- Review: http://www.html5accessibility.com/
  -- output element?
  -- Placeholder handling -- provide warning if it is the only source of label, what are the appropriate elements it is on?
  -- What does the semantic view do for invalid links. Should show text but not make it a link.
  -- Display settings summary in the HTML Reports
  -- fnGetDocuments needs to be investigated for completeness
  -- verify highlighters get the right elements, the fnGetXXX routines need verified
  -- role="radiogroup" how should this be handled? QA This!!
Options came up incorrect. Why?

What's up with this:
1	<UL id="menu" role="navigation" aria-label="Main Navigation">	1	Main Navigation navigation landmark	aria-label attribute, role attribute	navigation
    Warning: Landmark name does not need to be in the element label.

  List of ARIA roles to ignore and warn about not being well supported?
	Generate a set of QA pages for quick sanity check testing. Use pages and a protocol to exercise the program an inspect for errors, unexpected results, and warnings.
    Need to investigate the effective label on ARIA roles -- especially on div, spans, links, etc. Make a list. Spider for common aria roles.
       - Headings
       - buttons
       - sliders
       - etc.
    **** What about nested fieldsets and legends. Do the legends stack? [No, they do not. Need to make sure we provide a warning.]
    **** Add flag to allow ARIA to be sufficient for meeting labeling / text requiremnts(images, form fields, etc.)
    **** Add flag to force empty columns to appear in inspector dialogs
    **** Add flag to force empty columns to appear in HTML reports

    **** Finish inherited role detection

    ***** Check if implicit labels on a form control really preempt explicit labels (when both are present, and update fnGetEffectiveLabel routine)
    ***** Make a QA file for elements that we don't think should get their label from a fieldset legend and verify against JAWS
    MAJOR: Make a QA file for ARIA elements (on divs), and determine how they get their label (role=...)

    ***** Should recursiveText function pick up title attributes on divs and spans?
    Can we get text to wrap in a cell of the trees? Especially for element description fields, table captions, table summaries, determine the others...

      HTML5 allows rich IDs. Do we need to update the Valid ID routines? Do we need to be sensitive to doctype when testing IDs?
      Apparently name attribute values can be "rich", what ever that means, and include entities. If so, we need to look at the valid name routines.
