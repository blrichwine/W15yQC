  <p>This tool helps check single HTML pages for basic web accessibility issues
	to help ensure the content can be accessed by everyone. The Checker is offered
	as a free tool to assist in the creation of accessible web pages.
	As a tool however, it has its	limitations, and interpretation and understanding
	of the requirements and Success Criteria is an integral part of achieving
	accessible content. </p>
	
	The Checker identifies 3 types of problems:

    Known Problems: These are problems that have been identified with certainty as accessibility barriers. You must modify your page to fix these problems;
    Likely Problems: These are problems that have been identified as probable barriers, but require a human to make a decision. You will likely need to modify your page to fix these problems;
    Potential Problems: These are problems that AChecker cannot identify, that require a human decision. You may have to modify your page for these problems, but in many cases you will just need to confirm that the problem described is not present.

The Checker also can be used to connect to the W3C code validation service, which can review your source code for syntax conformance.
